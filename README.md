<h2>Thoughts</h2>

This project took me 3 days to finish. I've encountered obstacles with data structure, so I imitated [Dylan Codes](https://github.com/dylan-codesYT/WeatherApp) whose codes are clear and easy to understand, how he structured/named, and added functions of my own version. 

Tkinter is basic but handy for simple UI needs. But tkinter is not very customisable on macOS.
